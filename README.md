### Description:

For this test it will be used the page https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm
and there will be tested its methods for registering a new user, login, creating a new account, getting an overview of all the accounts, and transfering between accounts.

### Run the tests:

To run the tests right click on  the java folder at the directory "..src/test/java", then click on the "Run" option and next select "All Tests" (JUnit version).
Also by clicking on the play button at the top of the TestFront.class or at the TestBack.class.

Finally, try generating a new Suite at the run/debug configurations editor and adding a new configuration for JUnit with the tag "Regression". Then run it.


### Observations:

In case the test for the register method fails please check if the user was already created. 
For instance, if you run all the tests and the register for the TestFront.class fails it may be due to the user was already created at the TestBack.class.
